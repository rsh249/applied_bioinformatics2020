# Course Description:

This course explores the growing field of Bioinformatics through hands-on and project based learning. Students will develop basic computational skills to process common biological data streams including programming in R and/or Python. The class will develop skills through a combination of hands-on tech tutorials, a survey of current bioinformatics literature related to the topic area, and group and individual project development.  The course will be hyper-focused around one main technology or research question but will introduce and develop computational skills that are widely transferable across Bioinformatics.

The 2020 Spring semester course will focus on generating and analyzing data from environmental DNA (eDNA). eDNA is any molecule of DNA that can be recovered from non-tissue sources such as soil, water, and air. Modern DNA sequencing technology has become sensitive enough to detect and sequence trace amounds of DNA and so has opened new avenues of research in microbiomics, metagenomics, ancient DNA, and biodiversity monitoring. We will be sequencing eDNA using the the Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencer. The MinION is a benchtop, real-time DNA sequencer that is revolutionizing the field of genomics by providing portable and inexpensive DNA sequencing. We will be generating data and exploring bioinformatics tools available to process Nanopore data. Students will contribute to an ongoing research project through lab, field, and computational development.
